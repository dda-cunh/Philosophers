# Philo
		42 project introductory to the concept of threads, multi-threading and mutexes.
		N philosophers seat at a table and require two forks to eat.
		There are as many forks as philosophers.
		The program should simulate the actions a philo has to do while eating and it should avoid the death of a philosopher.

# Philo_bonus
		The bonus part is the same problem but solved using processes and semaphores.
